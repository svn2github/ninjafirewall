		<strong>HTTP / HTTPS</strong>
		<li>Whether to filter HTTP and/or HTTPS traffic.</li>

		<br />

		<strong>Uploads</strong>
		<li>File Uploads:<span class="description"> whether to allow/disallow file uploads.</span></li>
		<li>Sanitise filenames:<span class="description"> any character that is not a letter <code>a-zA-Z</code>, a digit <code>0-9</code>, a dot <code>.</code>, a hyphen <code>-</code> or an underscore <code>_</code> will be removed from the filename and replaced with the <code>X</code> character.</span></li>

		<br />

		<strong>HTTP GET variable</strong>
		<li>Whether to scan and/or sanitise the <code>GET</code> variable.</li>

		<br />

		<strong>HTTP POST variable</strong>
		<li>Whether to scan and/or sanitise the <code>POST</code> variable.</li>
		<li>Decode base64-encoded <code>POST</code> variable:<span class="description"> NinjaFirewall will decode and scan base64 encoded values in order to detect obfuscated malicious code. This option is only available for the <code>POST</code> variable.</span></li>

		<br />

		<strong>HTTP REQUEST variable</strong>
		<li>Whether to sanitise the <code>REQUEST</code> variable.</li>


		<br />
				<strong>Cookies</strong>
		<li>Whether to scan and/or sanitise cookies.</li>

		<br />

		<strong>HTTP_USER_AGENT server variable</strong>
		<li>Whether to scan and/or sanitise <code>HTTP_USER_AGENT</code> requests.</li>
		<li>Block suspicious bots/scanners:<span class="description"> rejects some known bots, scanners and various malicious scripts attempting to access your blog.</span></li>

		<br />

		<strong>HTTP_REFERER server variable</strong>
		<li>Whether to scan and/or sanitise <code>HTTP_REFERER</code> requests.</li>
		<li>Block POST requests that do not have an <code>HTTP_REFERER</code> header:<span class="description"> this option will block any <code>POST</code> request that does not have a Referrer header (<code>HTTP_REFERER</code> variable). If you need external applications to post to your scripts (e.g. Paypal IPN, WordPress WP-Cron...), you are advised to keep this option disabled otherwise they will likely be blocked. Note that <code>POST</code> requests are not required to have a Referrer header and, for that reason, this option is disabled by default.</span></li>

		<br />

		<strong>HTTP response headers</strong>
		<br />
		In addition to filtering incoming requests, NinjaFirewall can also hook the HTTP response in order to alter its headers. Those modifications can help to mitigate threats such as XSS, phishing and clickjacking attacks.
		<br />
		<li>Set <code>X-Content-Type-Options</code> to protect against MIME type confusion attacks:<span class="description"> sending this response header with the <code>nosniff</code> value will prevent compatible browsers from MIME-sniffing a response away from the declared content-type.</span></li>
		<li>Set <code>X-Frame-Options</code> to protect against clickjacking attempts:<span class="description"> this header indicates a policy whether a browser must not allow to render a page in a &lt;frame&gt; or &lt;iframe&gt;. Hosts can declare this policy in the header of their HTTP responses to prevent clickjacking attacks, by ensuring that their content is not embedded into other pages or frames. NinjaFirewall accepts two different values:
			<ul>
				<li><code>SAMEORIGIN</code>: a browser receiving content with this header must not display this content in any frame from a page of different origin than the content itself.</li>
				<li><code>DENY</code>: a browser receiving content with this header must not display this content in any frame.</li>
			</ul>
			</span>
			NinjaFirewall does not support the <code>ALLOW-FROM</code> value.
			<br />
			Since v3.1.3, WordPress sets this value to <code>SAMEORIGIN</code> for the administrator and the login page only.</li>
		<li>Set <code>X-XSS-Protection</code> to enable browser\'s built-in XSS filter (IE, Chrome and Safari):<span class="description"> this header allows compatible browsers to identify and block XSS attack by preventing the malicious script from executing. NinjaFirewall will set its value to <code>1; mode=block</code>.</span></li>
		<li>Force <code>HttpOnly</code> flag on all cookies to mitigate XSS attacks:<span class="description"> adding this flag to cookies helps to mitigate the risk of cross-site scripting by preventing them from being accessed through client-side script. NinjaFirewall can hook all cookies sent by your blog, its plugins or any other PHP script, add the <code>HttpOnly</code> flag if it is missing, and re-inject those cookies back into your server HTTP response headers right before they are sent to your visitors. Note that WordPress sets that flag on the logged in user cookies only.</span></li>
		<p><img src="' . plugins_url( '/images/icon_warn_16.png', __FILE__ ) . '" height="16" border="0" width="16">&nbsp;<span class="description">If your PHP scripts send cookies that need to be accessed from JavaScript, you should keep that option disabled.</span></p>
		<li>Set <code>Strict-Transport-Security</code> (HSTS) to enforce secure connections to the server:<span class="description"> this policy enforces secure HTTPS connections to the server. Web browsers will not allow the user to access the web application over insecure HTTP protocol. It helps to defend against cookie hijacking and Man-in-the-middle attacks. Most recent browsers support HSTS headers.</span></li>

		<br />

		<strong>IP</strong>
		<li>Block localhost IP in <code>GET/POST</code> requests:<span class="description"> this option will block any <code>GET</code> or <code>POST</code> request containing the localhost IP (127.0.0.1). It can be useful to block SQL dumpers and various hacker\'s shell scripts.</span></li>
		<li>Block HTTP requests with an IP in the <code>HTTP_HOST</code> header:<span class="description"> this option will reject any request using an IP instead of a domain name in the <code>Host</code> header of the HTTP request. Unless you need to connect to your site using its IP address, (e.g. http://' . htmlspecialchars($_SERVER['SERVER_ADDR']) . '/index.php), enabling this option will block a lot of hackers scanners because such applications scan IPs rather than domain names.</span></li>
		<li>Scan traffic coming from localhost and private IP address spaces:<span class="description"> this option will allow the firewall to scan traffic from all non-routable private IPs (IPv4 and IPv6) as well as the localhost IP. We recommend to keep it enabled if you have a private network (2 or more servers interconnected).</span></li>

		<br />

		<strong>PHP</strong>
		<li>Block PHP built-in wrappers:<span class="description"> PHP has several wrappers for use with the filesystem functions. It is possible for an attacker to use them to bypass firewalls and various IDS to exploit remote and local file inclusions. This option lets you block any script attempting to pass a <code>php://</code> or a <code>data://</code> stream inside a <code>GET</code> or <code>POST</code> request, cookies, user agent and referrer variables.</span></li>
		<li>Hide PHP notice &amp; error messages:<span class="description"> this option lets you hide errors returned by your scripts. Such errors can leak sensitive informations which can be exploited by hackers.</span></li>
		<li>Sanitise <code>PHP_SELF</code>, <code>PATH_TRANSLATED</code>, <code>PATH_INFO</code>:<span class="description"> this option can sanitise any dangerous characters found in those 3 server variables to prevent various XSS and database injection attempts.</span></li>

		<br />

		<strong>Various</strong>
		<li>Block the <code>DOCUMENT_ROOT</code> server variable <code>' . getenv( 'DOCUMENT_ROOT' ) . '</code> in HTTP requests:<span class="description"> this option will block scripts attempting to pass the <code>DOCUMENT_ROOT</code> server variable in a <code>GET</code> or <code>POST</code> request. Hackers use shell scripts that often need to pass this value, but most legitimate programs do not.</span></li>
		<li>Block ASCII character 0x00 (NULL byte):<span class="description"> this option will reject any <code>GET</code> or <code>POST</code> request, <code>COOKIE</code>, <code>HTTP_USER_AGENT</code>, <code>REQUEST_URI</code>, <code>PHP_SELF</code>, <code>PATH_INFO</code> variables containing the ASCII character 0x00 (NULL byte). Such a character is dangerous and should always be rejected.</span></li>
		<li>Block ASCII control characters 1 to 8 and 14 to 31:<span class="description"> in most cases, those control characters are not needed and should be rejected as well.</span></li>

		<br />

		<strong>WordPress</strong>
		<li>Whether to block direct access to PHP files located in specific WordPress directories.</li>
		<li>Protect against username enumeration:<span class="description"> it is possible to enumerate usernames either through the WordPress author archives or the login page. Although this is not a vulnerability but a WordPress feature, some hackers use it to retrieve usernames in order to launch more accurate brute-force attacks. NinjaFirewall will not block the request but, if it is a failed login attempt, it will sanitise the error message returned by WordPress and, if it is an author archives scan, it will invalidate it and redirect the user to the blog index page.</span></li>
		<li>Block access to WordPress XML-RPC API:<span class="description"> XML-RPC is a remote procedure call (RPC) protocol which uses XML to encode its calls and HTTP as a transport mechanism. WordPress has an XMLRPC API that can be accessed through the <code>xmlrpc.php</code> file. Since WordPress version 3.5, it is always activated and cannot be turned off. NinjaFirewall allows you to block any access to that file. This option is not enabled by default.</span></li>
		<li>Block <code>POST</code> requests in the themes folder <code>/wp-content/themes</code>:<span class="description"> this option can be useful to block hackers from installing backdoor in the PHP theme files. However, because some custom themes may include an HTML form (contact, search form etc), this option is not enabled by default.</span></li>
		<li>Force SSL for admin and logins <code>FORCE_SSL_ADMIN</code>:<span class="description"> enable this option when you want to secure logins and the admin area so that both passwords and cookies are never sent in the clear. <font color="red"><strong>Warning:</strong></font> ensure that you can access your admin console from HTTPS before enabling this option, otherwise you will lock yourself out of your site&nbsp;!</span></li>
		<li>Disable the plugin and theme editor <code>DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT</code>:<span class="description"> disabling the plugin and theme editor provides an additional layer of security if a hacker gains access to a well-privileged user account.</span></li>
		<li>Disable plugin and theme update/installation <code>DISALLOW_FILE_MODS</code>:<span class="description"> this option will block users being able to use the plugin and theme installation/update functionality from the WordPress admin area. Setting this constant also disables the Plugin and Theme editor.</span></li>

		<p>By processing incoming HTTP requests <strong>before your blog and any of its plugins</strong>, NinjaFirewall is the only plugin for WordPress able to protect it against very large brute-force attacks, including distributed attacks coming from several thousands of different IPs.
		<br />
		The protection applies to the <code>wp-login.php</code> script but can be extended to the <code>xmlrpc.php</code> one.</p>

		<p>You can select to enable the protection only if an attack is detected or to keep it always activated:</p>

		<strong>Yes, if under attack :</strong>
		<br />When too many login attempts are detected, it password-protects the login page immediately, regardless of the offending IP. It blocks the attack instantly and prevents it from reaching WordPress, but still allows you to access your administration console using a predefined username/password combination.

		<p><code>ninjafirewall[<font color="red">AA</font>]: Possible brute-force attack from <font color="red">BB</font> on <font color="red">CC</font> (<font color="red">DD</font>). Blocking access for <font color="red">EE</font>mn.</code><p>
		<ul>
			<li>AA: the process ID (PID).</li>
			<li>BB: the offending IPv4 or IPv6 address.</li>
			<li>CC: the blog (sub-)domain name.</li>
			<li>DD: the target: it can be either <code>wp-login.php</code> or <code>XML-RPC API</code>.</li>
			<li>EE: the time, in minutes, the protection will remain active.</li>
		</ul>
		Sample loglines:
		<br />
