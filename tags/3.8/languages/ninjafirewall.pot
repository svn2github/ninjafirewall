"Although NinjaFirewall looks like a regular security plugin, it is not. It "

"a stand-alone Web Application Firewall that sits in front of WordPress."
msgstr ""

"modes."

#: install.php:142
msgid ""
"In <b>Full WAF</b> mode, NinjaFirewall will hook, scan, reject or sanitise "
"any HTTP and HTTPS request sent to a PHP script before it reaches WordPress, "
"its plugins or even the database. All scripts located inside the blog "
"installation directories and sub-directories will be protected, including "
"those that aren't part of the WordPress package. Even encoded PHP scripts (e."
"g., ionCube), potential backdoors and shell scripts (e.g., c99, r57) will be "

"To run NinjaFirewall in <b>Full WAF</b> mode, your server must allow the use "
